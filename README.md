# how2discordjs
### What is this?
A fun little project to make a website that gives helpful info on making "bots" (api calls, replies, etc..) for Discord via discord.js

### Can I contribute?
I mean.. feel free to make a pull request, if I like it enough I'll add it to the main site

### Will this stay public?
Yeah.

### Will this stay updated with discord.js?
...probably? I'm not sure yet. I'm enjoying it now and I've enjoyed showing others how to code, and make Discord bots for a long time.
